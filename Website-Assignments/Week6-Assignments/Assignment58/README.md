# Addition With Index

### Task

We have multiple arrays and a set of variables.
The task is to use these variables to access the elements of the arrays and apply what you have learned to get the required value, which is the number 150.
You are allowed to use only the plus sign (+) to obtain the required result.
You are not allowed to use any numbers manually, and you must not change the first six lines of the code.

### Provided Code

```cpp
// Do Not Edit The Next 6 Lines
int nums[] = {1, 2, 3, 5};
int vals[] = {10, 20, 40, 30, 10, 60};
int i1 = nums[3];
int i2 = nums[0];
int i3 = nums[1];
int i4 = nums[2];

// Need To Get Ouput 150
// You Can Use Plus Operator Only
