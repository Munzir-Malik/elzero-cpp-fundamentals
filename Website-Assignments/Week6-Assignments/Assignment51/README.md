# Check If Plaindrome

### Task

We have an array, and its elements will change.
We want to check whether the array is palindromic or not — meaning it reads the same forward and backward.

In other words:

The first element should be equal to the last element.

The second element should be equal to the second-to-last element, and so on.

In the future, you’ll learn easier ways to do this, but for now, you should solve it using only what you have learned about conditions (if statements).

The required solution should work correctly for the three given examples only.

### Provided Code

```cpp
// Example 1
int vals[] = {100, 200, 600, 200, 100};

// Output
"Array Is Palindrome"

// Example 2
int vals[] = {100, 200, 200, 100};

// Output
"Array Is Palindrome"

// Example 3
int vals[] = {100, 300, 600, 200, 100};

// Output
"Array Is Not Palindrome"
